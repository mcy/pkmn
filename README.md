# `pkmn`, a PokéAPI client for Rust

This project consists of two parts: `pkmn`, a high-quality client crate for 
PokéAPI, and `pdex`, a terminal-based Pokédex based on `pkmn`.

Both are currently in active development, and will be published to crates.io
once they're in a state of lesser flux.

Patches welcome. Most of the library is untested against the PokéAPI itself and
is may parse some responses incorrectly.
